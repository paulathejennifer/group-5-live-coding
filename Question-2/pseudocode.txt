Process
1. Gather real-time data on patient needs, available beds, staff, and equipment.
2. Assign priority scores to patients based on urgency and waiting time.
3. Sort patients by priority (highest to lowest).
4. For each patient (starting with the highest priority), check if needed bed, staff, and equipment are available.
5. If all resources are available, allocate them and update their status to "in use".
6. If any resource is unavailable, keep the patient in the queue and check the next one.
7. When a surge in patients occurs, activate extra resources and update priorities.
8. Regularly update resource availability and patient conditions.
9. Repeat allocation and monitoring steps continuously for efficiency.
